# Wassup ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Dan, I make excessive use of emojis ðŸ˜‚, write some code from time to time ðŸ’», [once won a blockchain hackathon](https://twitter.com/CoderDan/status/1287686296190758912), [was featured on my university's youtube channel and computer science home page](https://dan-oak.dev/PizzaHeaven%20Recording.mp4) with [this](https://github.com/PRCS251A) project, and generally poke around with tech âš¡. I'm very approachable and love a good nerd pun ðŸ¤“. My current jam is making useful apps with C#.
