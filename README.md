### Wassup 👋!

I make excessive use of emojis 😂, write some code from time to time 💻, [once won a blockchain hackathon](https://twitter.com/CoderDan/status/1287686296190758912), [was featured on my university's youtube channel and computer science home page](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQo8j2BtDrM) with [this](https://github.com/PRCS251A) project, and generally poke around with tech ⚡. I'm very approachable and love a good nerd pun 🤓. My current jam is making useful apps with C# / Vue.js. 

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CoderDan) 🐤.
