### Wassup 👋!

I make excessive use of emojis 😂, write some code from time to time 💻, and generally poke around with tech ⚡. I'm very approachable and love a good nerd pun 🤓. My current jam is making useful apps with C# / Vue.js. 

You can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iDanScott) 🐤 or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/idanscott/).
